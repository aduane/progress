# Progress Bars as a Service

Sometimes I want to be able to remotely monitor progress on tasks. The idea
here is that you register a task, then have whatever automated process report
in on the progress as it goes. An example would be a custom test reporter that
registers a task for the test run, then reports in every time a test
completes. You can go grab that handful of trail mix from the kitchen and
check in on your test suite's progress from your phone. Websockets keep you up
to date on how things are going. Pretty neat, huh?
